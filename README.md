Ever since my early youth, I've been enamored with computer science principles such as data analytics and artificial intelligence. 
Because of this, I'm currently majoring in Computer Science at the University of Illinois - Chicago (UIC). 
Some of my favorite programming languges inclue javascript, python, and c++. I plan to graduate from UIC with a BS in Computer Science and then pursue a graduate degree in a related fields. My long-term goal is to become a Software Engineer/Data Scientist.
