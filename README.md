Ever since my early youth, I've been enamored with the prospect of bridging medicine with 
computer science principles such as data analytics and Artificial Intelligence. Because of this, I'm currently majoring in Computer Science one Pre-Medicine track at the University of Illinois - Chicago (UIC). Additionally, I'm a member of the second cohort of the Dusable Scholars Program (DSP). This program aims to serve BIPOC students majoring in STEM who wish to pursue research opportunities and/or attend graduate school which is my intended path. I plan to graduate from UIC with a BS in Computer Science and then matriculate to medical school. My long-term goal is to become a surgical oncologist in order to help marginalized communities receive high-quality healthcare.
